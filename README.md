# A Simple Voice Recognizer in Java using Sphinx4 and Swing
**Description:**

We create a simple voice recognizer using Sphinx4 library in Java which is responsible for processing voice commands and acting upon them, and 
Swing library was used to create a GUI consisting of a basic home environment where we have different blocks pertaining to different rooms in a house
and upon giving commands such as "turn on kitchen lights" the colour of the "kitchen" block changes. This was a simple virtual demonstration of home automation.
